# arduino
This repo is not a public project -- it's being used to share code academically. We're currently focused on basic Arduino concepts, rather than advanced coding concepts, but slick tricks are always welcome. Errorhandling is intentionally light, to improve code clarity for beginners.

As such, we aren't in need of committers, but we're happy to share whatever we're holding -- so feel free to fork off, for all we care! ðŸ˜‰
